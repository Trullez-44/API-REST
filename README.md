## Installation

This is a repository for API REST that contains an HTML file and other related resources.

### Download from GitHub

You can also download the repository directly from GitHub by following these steps:

1. Visit the repository's main page on GitHub at the following URL:

   https://github.com/Trullez-44/API-REST.git

2. Click the green "Code" button in the top right corner and select "Download ZIP."

3. Unzip the downloaded ZIP file on your machine.

4. Navigate to the extracted project directory and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Download via Console
Follow these steps to download the repository and run the HTML file on your local server using the command line:

1. **Clone the repository**: Open your terminal or command line and execute the following command to clone the repository to your machine:

   git clone https://github.com/Trullez-44/API-REST.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the `cd` command to enter the project directory:

   cd API-REST.git

3. **Run a local server**: You can use any local web server to serve the HTML file. If you don't have a local web server set up, you can use Python's HTTP server (if you have Python installed):

   # For Python 2.x
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer

   # For Python 3.x
   python -m http.server
   

   This will start a local server on port 8000 (by default).

4. **Access the HTML file**: Open your web browser and go to the following URL:

   http://localhost:8000/index.html

   Make sure to replace the port (8000) if you are using a different port. You should see your `index.html` file loaded on your local server.
